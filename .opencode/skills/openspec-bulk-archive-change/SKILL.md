Archive multiple completed changes in a single operation.

This skill allows you to batch-archive changes, handling spec conflicts intelligently by checking the codebase to determine what's actually implemented.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Every unscoped example of those commands below is shorthand: before running it, append the flag. For example, run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json --store "<id>"`, not the unscoped form shown below. Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Project check:** These steps expect a project that already uses OpenSpec. Before the first step that writes anything (`new change`, `archive`, `sync specs`, or authoring an artifact file), confirm the project has a root: run `openspec list --json` (with `--store <id>` when a store is selected, since the store is then the root) and read `root`. A root object means the project is set up. `"root": null` means it is not - there is no `openspec/` directory here, and a write such as `openspec new change` would create one as a side effect. The command also exits non-zero, which is that answer rather than a broken CLI, so read the JSON instead of retrying or working around it.

One `"root": null` is not about setup: when a `status` error message starts with `Declared in` or `Invalid store declaration in` and names this project's `openspec/config.yaml` (or `config.yml`), the project does use OpenSpec through a store it declares, which this machine cannot resolve (the store is not registered, or the `store:` line is malformed). Do not treat it as uninitialized and skip the branches below: stop before writing and show the user that error's `message` and `fix`.

Otherwise, with no root, what happens next depends on how this workflow was reached:

- **Auto-selected**: you chose this workflow yourself, without the user naming OpenSpec, naming this skill, or running its slash command. Stop using OpenSpec and answer the request normally, as you would with no OpenSpec installed. Do not ask them to set anything up and do not mention OpenSpec setup.
- **Explicit OpenSpec request**: the user named OpenSpec, named this skill, or ran its slash command. Stop before writing and ask how to proceed: set this project up (`openspec init`), target a store they already have (`--store <id>`), or continue without OpenSpec for this request. Wait for their answer.

In both branches, never create the root as a side effect: do not run `openspec init` until the user asks for it, do not hand-create `openspec/` files, and do not let a command create it.

`<capability-path>` is the spec directory relative to `specs/` (for example, `user-auth` or `identity/user-auth`). Preserve the full path from each delta spec when resolving its main spec.

**Input**: None required (prompts for selection)

**Steps**

1. **Get active changes**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get all active changes.

   If no active changes exist, inform user and stop.

2. **Prompt for change selection**

   Ask the user to choose changes (multi-select):
   - Show each change name and task status from the list output
   - Include an option for "All changes"
   - Allow any number of selections (1+ works, 2+ is the typical use case)

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT auto-select. Always let the user choose.

   **Load current archive inputs once for the selected root before batch validation:**

   Choose one selected change from this root and run
   `openspec instructions archive --change "<selected-change>" --json` with the
   same selected-root flags. This lookup is advisory and optional: it only supplies
   extra prompt inputs, so it must never block the batch. If it fails or returns
   invalid JSON — for example on an older CLI that does not support this command
   yet — continue the batch with no context and no operation guidance. Do not
   report an error and do not stop.

   A valid response may omit `context` and `operationGuidance`. Treat
   `context` as a required prompt-level input across the batch: read and consider
   it, and apply relevant project facts, conventions, and constraints. Treat
   `operationGuidance` as optional additive advice: read and consider every
   entry, and follow entries that are applicable and compatible with the built-in
   batch workflow.

   Keep both fields separate from conflict analysis, explicit user choices,
   resolved paths, CLI checks, and command contracts. If context conflicts with one
   of those controlling inputs, report the conflict and preserve the controlling
   value. If guidance is inapplicable or conflicts with a controlling input, do not
   follow it and explain why. Do not infer skipped prompts, replacement paths, or
   flags from either field, and do not copy their text verbatim into specs, changes,
   or summaries. These are prompt-level behavior contracts, not enforceable checks.

3. **Batch validation - gather status for all selected changes**

   Run `openspec list --json` once with the same selected-root flags for task
   progress. If the lookup fails, returns invalid JSON, or omits any selected
   change, contains a duplicate selected change, or returns invalid counts,
   report the problem and stop before syncing or archiving the batch.

   For each selected change, collect:

   a. **Artifact status** - Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
   - Parse `schemaName`, `artifacts`, `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`
   - Note which artifacts are `done` vs other states

   b. **Task completion** - Find the `changes` entry from the list response whose `name` exactly matches this change
   - Require nonnegative integer `totalTasks` and `completedTasks`, with `completedTasks <= totalTasks`
   - Incomplete tasks = `totalTasks - completedTasks`
   - The CLI resolves the schema's tracked task files, including custom artifact names, output paths, and globs
   - Do not infer task completion from artifact status, an artifact id of `tasks`, or the absence of a top-level `tasks.md`
   - The CLI counts only `x`/`X` checkbox markers as complete; other markers remain incomplete
   - If `totalTasks` is zero, note as "No tasks"

   c. **Delta specs** - Check `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON
   - List which capability specs exist
   - For each, extract requirement names (lines matching `### Requirement: <name>`)
   - Treat this list as the only delta-spec source. If the `specs` entry is
     missing or the list is empty, perform no spec sync or specs-instruction
     lookup for that change; do not infer deltas from unrelated artifacts.
   - Evaluate this independently for every change, including mixed-schema
     batches where some schemas have no `specs` artifact.

   d. **Archive target** - Compute each change's target name once and record it as that change's `<target-name>`
   - Use the change name as-is when it already starts with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix; otherwise prepend the current date as `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>` (same rule as `openspec archive`)
   - Check whether `<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/<target-name>` already exists
   - If it exists, or another selected change resolves to the same target name, mark every such change `Blocked` with `Archive directory already exists`
   - A blocked change is never synced or moved: show it as `Blocked` in the step 6 table, leave it out of conflict resolution (resolve its conflicts using only the other changes), and record it as Failed in step 8d
   - Checking here, before any main spec is written, matches `openspec archive`: a collision found after sync would leave main specs rewritten for an archive that never happened

4. **Detect spec conflicts**

   Build a map keyed by `<capability-path>`, the exact path relative to `specs/`:

   ```text
   identity/user-auth -> [change-a, change-b]  <- CONFLICT (2+ changes)
   billing/user-auth  -> [change-c]            <- OK (different full path)
   ```

   A conflict exists when 2+ selected changes have delta specs for the exact same `<capability-path>`.

5. **Resolve conflicts agentically**

   **For each conflict**, investigate the codebase:

   a. **Read the delta specs** from each conflicting change to understand what each claims to add/modify

   b. **Search the codebase** for implementation evidence:
   - Look for code implementing requirements from each delta spec
   - Check for related files, functions, or tests

   c. **Determine resolution**:
   - If only one change is actually implemented -> sync that one's specs
   - If both implemented -> apply in chronological order (older first, newer overwrites)
   - If neither implemented -> skip spec sync, warn user

   d. **Record resolution** for each conflict:
   - An inclusion or exclusion decision for every delta spec, keyed by change and `<capability-path>`
   - Which included delta specs to apply and in what order
   - Which delta specs to exclude from sync because their implementation is missing
   - Rationale (what was found in codebase)

6. **Show consolidated status table**

   Display a table summarizing all changes:

   ```markdown
   | Change            | Artifacts | Tasks | Specs   | Conflicts              | Status |
   | ----------------- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
   | schema-management | Done      | 5/5   | 2 delta | None                   | Ready  |
   | project-config    | Done      | 3/3   | 1 delta | None                   | Ready  |
   | add-oauth         | Done      | 4/4   | 1 delta | identity/user-auth (!) | Ready* |
   | add-verify-skill  | 1 left    | 2/5   | None    | None                   | Warn   |
   ```

   For conflicts, show the resolution:

   ```text
   * Conflict resolution:
     - identity/user-auth spec: Will apply add-oauth then add-jwt (both implemented, chronological order)
   ```

   For incomplete changes, show warnings:

   ```text
   Warnings:
   - add-verify-skill: 1 incomplete artifact, 3 incomplete tasks
   ```

7. **Confirm batch operation**

   Ask the user a single confirmation question:

   - "Archive N changes?" with options based on status
   - Options might include:
     - "Archive all N changes"
     - "Archive only N ready changes (skip incomplete)"
     - "Cancel"

   If there are incomplete changes, make clear they'll be archived with warnings.

   Route on the answer by intent, not by exact label — you wrote these labels,
   so match what the user picked rather than the wording above:
   - "Cancel" — stop, do not archive. Report that nothing was archived and skip the remaining steps.
   - The archive-everything option — proceed with every selected change that is not `Blocked`
   - The ready-only option — proceed with only the changes the step 6 table marks `Ready` or `Ready*`, and record the rest as Skipped in step 8d, except `Blocked` changes, which stay Failed with `Archive directory already exists`. If a `Ready*` change's conflict partner is skipped, re-derive that conflict's resolution using only the changes being archived.
   - Anything else — ask again rather than archiving

   Before step 8 writes the first main spec or moves any change, fetch every
   required specs-rule snapshot for the confirmed batch. For each change that will
   sync concrete `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths`, run
   `openspec instructions specs --change "<name>" --json` exactly once with the
   same selected-root flags. Obtain all snapshots before the first write or move.
   If any lookup exits non-zero or returns invalid artifact-instruction JSON,
   identify the affected change, report the error, and stop the whole batch before
   any main-spec write or change move. Do not treat lookup failure as omitted
   rules. A valid response without `rules` is the no-rules case.

8. **Execute archive for each confirmed change**

   Before processing, carry the recorded decisions from step 5 (after any step 7 re-derivation) into two per-delta sets:
   - `includedDeltas`: all non-conflicting delta specs from confirmed changes plus conflict deltas selected for sync
   - `excludedDeltas`: conflict deltas from confirmed changes excluded because their implementation is missing
   - A single change can have both included and excluded delta specs. Keep the decision per delta; do not collapse it into a per-change sync flag.

   Process changes in the determined order (respecting conflict resolution):

   a. **Sync included delta specs**:
   - Run the `openspec-sync-specs` workflow inline (agent-driven intelligent merge) only for changes with entries in `includedDeltas`, passing only the included delta paths and explicitly instructing it to ignore that change's `excludedDeltas`. Wait for it to finish.
   - If the sync reports any stop or blocking condition, treat the sync as failed. Stop processing that change immediately. Before continuing to the next change, record this change's outcome as Failed in the batch results, including the sync blocking/error condition.
   - Do not perform the post-sync content comparison and do not move its `changeRoot`; leave the change intact.
   - For conflicts, apply in resolved order.
   - Pass that change's fetched specs-rule snapshot into inline sync; inline
     sync must reuse it without fetching instructions again
   - Apply artifact rules only to main specs produced by that change. They do
     not change conflict resolution, archive behavior, or CLI contracts, and
     their text is not copied into an output file
   - Do not delegate to a background task — step 8c would move `changeRoot` out from under a sync that is still reading it.
   - If a change has no included delta specs, do not run the sync workflow for it.

   b. **Verify included delta specs before moving changeRoot**:
   - Re-run the comparison only for delta specs in `includedDeltas` against main spec at `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/<capability-path>/spec.md` (use the store-aware `planningHome.root` from step 3 status JSON, not a hardcoded repo path).
   - Verify that main specs are updated:
     - ADDED requirements present
     - MODIFIED requirements carrying scenario and description changes named in the delta, with their other scenarios intact
     - REMOVED requirements gone — and where this sync retired a capability (removed its last requirement, leaving `## Requirements` empty), its main spec deleted rather than left empty.
     - RENAMED requirements present under the new name and absent under the old one
   - Do not verify delta specs in `excludedDeltas`; they are intentionally left unsynced.
   - If sync failed or any capability does not match verification, report what differs and fail/skip moving that change's `changeRoot` — do not archive that change. `changeRoot` remains intact.

   c. **Perform the archive**:

   Target name: use the `<target-name>` recorded for this change in step 3d, unchanged. Never recompute it here: a batch that runs past midnight would check one date in step 3 and move to another.

   **Check if target already exists:**
   - Check again immediately before the move, even though step 3 already checked: the target can appear mid-batch
   - If yes: record this change as Failed with `Archive directory already exists`, leave `changeRoot` where it is, report any main specs step 8a already synced for it, and continue with the remaining changes
   - If no: move `changeRoot` to the archive directory

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive"
   mv "<changeRoot>" "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/<target-name>"
   ```

   **Confirm the move did not nest:** `mv` exits 0 even when the target appeared after the check, moving the change _inside_ it. If `<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/<target-name>/<change-directory-name>` now exists (the last path segment of `changeRoot`), move that directory back to `changeRoot` and record this change as Failed with `Archive directory already exists`. Never report it as archived.

   d. **Track outcome** for each change:
   - Success: archived successfully
   - Failed: error during archive or spec verification (record error)
   - Skipped: user chose not to archive (if applicable)
   - Sync skipped: for every delta in `excludedDeltas`, report `sync skipped` with the change, `<capability-path>`, and recorded reason. This is distinct from skipping the archive.

9. **Display summary**

   Show final results:

   ```markdown
   ## Bulk Archive Complete

   Archived 3 changes:

   - schema-management-cli -> archive/2026-01-19-schema-management-cli/
   - project-config -> archive/2026-01-19-project-config/
   - add-oauth -> archive/2026-01-19-add-oauth/

   Skipped 1 change:

   - add-verify-skill (user chose not to archive incomplete)

   Spec sync summary:

   - 4 delta specs synced to main specs
   - 1 delta spec sync skipped (add-jwt, identity/user-auth: implementation not found)
   - 1 conflict resolved (identity/user-auth: synced add-oauth, skipped add-jwt)
   ```

   If any failures:

   ```text
   Failed 1 change:
   - some-change: Archive directory already exists
   ```

**Conflict Resolution Examples**

Example 1: Only one implemented

```text
Conflict: <planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/auth/spec.md touched by [add-oauth, add-jwt]

Checking add-oauth:
- Delta adds "OAuth Provider Integration" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/auth/oauth.ts implementing OAuth flow

Checking add-jwt:
- Delta adds "JWT Token Handling" requirement
- Searching codebase... no JWT implementation found

Resolution: Only add-oauth is implemented. Will sync add-oauth specs only.
```

Example 2: Both implemented

```text
Conflict: <planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/api/spec.md touched by [add-rest-api, add-graphql]

Checking add-rest-api (created 2026-01-10):
- Delta adds "REST Endpoints" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/rest.ts

Checking add-graphql (created 2026-01-15):
- Delta adds "GraphQL Schema" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/graphql.ts

Resolution: Both implemented. Will apply add-rest-api specs first,
then add-graphql specs (chronological order, newer takes precedence).
```

**Guardrails**

- Allow any number of changes (1+ is fine, 2+ is the typical use case)
- Always prompt for selection, never auto-select
- Detect spec conflicts early and resolve by checking codebase
- When both changes are implemented, apply specs in chronological order
- Skip spec sync only when implementation is missing (warn user)
- Show clear per-change status before confirming
- Use single confirmation for entire batch
- Never archive after the user cancels the confirmation — a cancelled batch archives nothing
- Track and report all outcomes (success/skip/fail)
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive
- Archive directory target uses the current date, computed once in step 3d and reused at the move: YYYY-MM-DD-<name>; a name that already starts with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix is used as-is (never stack a second date)
- If archive target exists, fail that change but continue with others
- Check every archive target in step 3, before the first main-spec write; a change whose target exists is never synced or moved
- If sync is requested, run the `openspec-sync-specs` workflow inline (agent-driven) for each change with included delta specs
- Carry the per-delta `includedDeltas` and `excludedDeltas` decisions into execution; sync and verify only included deltas
- Report every excluded delta as `sync skipped` without treating the archive itself as skipped
- Never archive a change while a spec sync is still in flight — run the sync inline and verify main specs at `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/<capability-path>/spec.md` before moving `changeRoot`
- Fetch archive inputs once per selected root before spec inspection or moves
- Fetch all required specs-rule snapshots before the batch's first main-spec write or move
- A failed archive-inputs lookup never blocks the batch; it proceeds with no context or guidance
- A failed specs instruction lookup stops the whole batch atomically
- Changes without concrete `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` continue without spec sync
- Apply relevant runtime context across the batch and report conflicts
- Operation guidance remains advisory; consider every entry and explain rejected advice
- Keep runtime inputs, conflict analysis, CLI-derived values, and artifact rules separate
- Artifact rules constrain only written specs
- Never copy runtime input or artifact-rule text verbatim into output files
