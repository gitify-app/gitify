### Download

You can download Gitify for **free** from the website [www.gitify.io](https://www.gitify.io/) or install it via [Homebrew Cask](http://brew.sh/).

```shell
brew install --cask gitify
```

Gitify supports macOS, Windows and Linux.

### Installation

    pnpm install

### Development

Optional: If you prefer to use your own OAuth credentials, you can do so by passing them as environment variables when bundling the app. This is optional as the app has some default "development" keys (use at your own discretion).

    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="123" OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="456789" pnpm build

To watch for changes(`webpack`) in the `src` directory:

    pnpm watch

To run the **electron app**:

    pnpm start

### Releases

The release process is automated. Follow the steps below.

1. Verify that all features you want targeted in the release have been merged to `main`.
2. Ensure [setchy/homebrew-cask](https://github.com/setchy/homebrew-cask/) is up to date.
3. Create a [new **draft** release](https://github.com/gitify-app/gitify/releases/new). Set the tag version to something with the format of `v1.2.3`. Save as a **draft** before moving to the next step
4. Create a branch that starts with `release/vX.X.X` (ie. `release/v1.2.3`).
5. In the same branch, **bump the version** of the app in the `package.json` file and open a PR. GitHub Actions will build, sign and upload the release assets for each commit to that branch as long as a branch is named like `release/vX.X.X` and there is a draft release with the same version number(`package.json`).
6. Merge your release branch into `main`.
7. Publish the release once you've finalized the release notes and confirmed all assets are there.
8. Raise and merge a pull request in [gitify-app/website](https://github.com/gitify-app/website) using the automatically created branch (ie: `bump/v1.2.3`)

### Tests

There are 2 checks - one for prettier and one for the unit tests with `jest`.

```
    // Run prettier to check
    pnpm prettier:check

    // Run linter & unit tests with coverage
    pnpm test

    // If you want to pass arguments to jest (or other `pnpm` commands)
    // like `--watch`, you can prepend `--` to the command
    pnpm test -- --watch
```
