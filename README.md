```

Gitify supports macOS, Windows and Linux.

### Prerequisites & Libraries

- Node 18+
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Installation

    pnpm install

### Development

Optional: If you prefer to use your own OAuth credentials, you can do so by passing them as environment variables when bundling the app. This is optional as the app has some default "development" keys (use at your own discretion).

    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="123" OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="456789" pnpm build

To watch for changes(`webpack`) in the `src` directory:

    pnpm run watch

To run the **electron app**:

    pnpm start

### Releases

The release process is automated. Follow the steps below.

1. Create a [new **draft** release](https://github.com/manosim/gitify/releases/new). Set the tag version to something with the format of `v1.2.3`. Save as a **draft**.
2. Once everything is merged to `main`, create a branch that starts with `release/vX.X.X` (ie. `release/v1.2.3`).
3. In the same branch, **bump the version** of the app in the `package.json` file and open a PR. GitHub Actions will build, sign and upload the release assets for each commit to that branch as long as a branch is named like `release/vX.X.X` and there is a draft release with the same version number(`package.json`).
4. Merge your release branch into `main`.
5. Publish the draft release once you've added notes to it and all assets are there.

### Tests

There are 2 checks - one for prettier and one for the unit tests with `jest`.

    // Run prettier to check
    pnpm run prettier:check

    // Run linter & unit tests with coverage
    pnpm run test

    // Run jest directly - allows to pass arguments like `--watch`
    pnpm run jest

### FAQ
